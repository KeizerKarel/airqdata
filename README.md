# Air quality data

These scripts retrieve and process air quality data, mainly on particulate
matter, for the Civic Labs Belgium air quality project. 
In this fork, location is set to Leuven, in front of the City Hall

They
* wrap the APIs of various sources, including Civic Labs Belgium's Google
Sheets, luftdaten.info, madavi.de and irceline.be
* clean and combine the retrieved data
* analyze and visualize the data

The [demo.ipynb](https://github.com/dr-1/airqdata/blob/master/demo.ipynb)
notebook shows how the modules can be used.

## Requirements
A Python 3.5+ environment is assumed. Several Python packages are required, see
requirements.txt. To install them, use Python's pip command or execute
install_requirements.sh, with elevated privileges
(`sudo ./install_requirements.sh`) if needed on your system.
